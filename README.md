# GraphQL Fullstack Boilerplate

A monorepo web application boilerplate with authentication, a graphQL api, database access, and material-ui styling.

# Tech stack 

ðŸ¤– [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - static types, used throughout the client and server (especially handy for the auto-generated prisma2 client).

ðŸŒš [Next 9](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) - server-side rendering, file-based routing in the `pages` directory, and serverless build of of graphql API within `pages/api/graphql.ts` using [API Routes](https://github.com/zeit/next.js#api-routes)

ðŸ¦‹ [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/hooks-migration/) (React Hooks API) - GraphQL client for queries and mutations.

ðŸ¦„ [Prisma 2](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2) - Next-generation database access and migration tools. *NOTE: Prisma 2 is currently in the preview phase and is not yet ready for use in production.*

ðŸ’… [Material UI](https://material-ui.com) - Material UI components, CSS-in-JS styles solutions, and theme.

# How to use


Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kunalgorithm/graphql-fullstack
```


install dependencies, then run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Create new data types 
Add new data fields by using the *lift*, prisma2's built-in database migration tool.

Install the prisma2 CLI 

```
npm install -g prisma2 
```

Then open `schema.prisma` in the `prisma` directory. Add a new optional field, _githubUrl_ to a data type, _User_. 

```
model User {
  id        String  @default(cuid()) @id
  email     String  @unique
  password  String
  firstName String
  lastName  String
}
```
becomes 
```
model User {
  id         String  @default(cuid()) @id
  email      String  @unique
  password   String
  firstName  String
  lastName   String
  githubUrl  String?
}
```

Note that `?` signals that the field is optional. 

Then, preview the migration by running `prisma2 lift save "Added githubUrl to User"` with an appropriate message, and run the migration with `prisma2 lift up`. Finally, generate a new photon client to accomodate the updated datamodel by running `prisma2 generate`. 




# Deploy

Deploy to the cloud with [now](https://zeit.co/now) ([download](https://zeit.co/download))

Install the `now` CLI

```bash
npm install --global now 
```

Then deploy using 
```bash
now
```



## Allocate and connect to a production database 

The boilerplate stores data by interfacing from Prisma2 to SQLite, a file-based relational database meant for development and testing. The development data is stored in `dev.db`, configured by the following in `prisma/schema.prisma`

```
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = "file:dev.db"
}
```

 Before supporting real users and data on your production app, consider creating a MySQL database on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) or other managed database provider. Prisma2 also supports Postgres and MongoDB, but the majority of their examples use MySQL, leading me to suspect it may be a more thoroughly tested integration. 

Once created, change the datastore value to 

```
datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = "mysql://YOUR_MYSQL_LINK"
}
```
